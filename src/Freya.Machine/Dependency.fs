(* Types

   Types representing dependencies of string key, plus types supporting
   a dependency graph. Additional types expressing the result of an analysis 
   of a preconstructed dependency graph, to find a simple valid ordering of
   dependencies.

   See later comments on Creation and Analysis. *)

type Dependency =
    | Dependency of DependencyRef * Set<DependencyRef>

and DependencyRef =
    | Ref of string

and DependencyRefPair =
    | Pair of DependencyRef * DependencyRef

and DependencyGraph =
    { Nodes: Set<DependencyRef>
      Edges: Set<DependencyRefPair> }

    static member NodesLens =
        (fun x -> x.Nodes), (fun n x -> { x with DependencyGraph.Nodes = n })

    static member EdgesLens =
        (fun x -> x.Edges), (fun e x -> { x with DependencyGraph.Edges = e })

type DependencyGraphAnalysis =
    | Ordered of DependencyRef list
    | Cyclic

(* Defaults

   Default instances of dependency data types, in this case
   and empty dependency graph containing no nodes and edges. *)

let private defaultGraph =
    { Nodes = Set.empty
      Edges = Set.empty }

(* Creation

   Functions for creating dependency graphs from a list
   of id and dependency list pairs. Forms a commonly modelled
   dependency graph as used for the basis of common topological sort
   algorithms.

   See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting] for details. *)

let private addNode (Dependency (x, _)) =
    modL DependencyGraph.NodesLens (Set.add x)

let private addEdges (Dependency (x, xs)) =
    modL DependencyGraph.EdgesLens (Set.union (Set.map (fun d -> Pair (x, d)) xs))

let createDependencyGraph =
    Set.fold (fun g e ->
        [ addNode e
          addEdges e ] |> List.fold (|>) g) defaultGraph

(* Analysis

   Dependency graph analysis attempts to sort dependencies in to
   topographically valid order based on dependencies. Kahn's
   algorithm is used to sort the nodes of the graph, leaving
   a dependency graph with an empty set of edges in the case of a
   valid dependency graph (one which excludes cyclic dependencies).

   See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting] for details. *)
