(* Functions

   Common type aliases for core functions used throughout
   Machine as basic node types. *)

    Freya<bool>

(* Configuration *)

type FreyaMachineConfiguration =
    Map<string, obj>

type FreyaMachineConfigurationMetadata =
    { Configurable: bool
      Configured: bool }

(* Graph

   Types used for defining elements of graphs, common to multiple
   graph definition types. Node and edge references are defined with
   simple string keys, relying on regular comparison. *)

type FreyaMachineRef =
    | Start
    | Finish
    | Ref of string

type FreyaMachineRefPair =
    | Pair of FreyaMachineRef * FreyaMachineRef

(* Definition

   Types representing the definition used to produce an execution
   graph, using a standard nodes and edges representation. Operations on
   the graph are represented as being able to succeed, as a mapping of
   definition graph -> definition graph, or fail as an error. *)

    FreyaMachineConfiguration -> FreyaMachineConfigurationMetadata * FreyaMachineBinary

and FreyaMachineEdge =
    | Value of bool option

type FreyaMachineGraphOperation =
    FreyaMachineGraph -> Choice<FreyaMachineGraph, string>

(* Extension

   Types supporting the extension of the basic (empty) machine graph
   through applying a set of operations to map the graph in to a new form.
   Names and dependencies are used to ensure some level of preconditional
   safety before operations from multiple extensions are applied.

   See the commentary around Dependency.fs more. *)
