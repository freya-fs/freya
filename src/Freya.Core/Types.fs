/// Note that the definition does not use a generic value for state but specifies <see cref="CoreState" />
/// explicitly as the state value. Further, this definition does not make use of a wrapped value but simply
/// provides an alias for the function definition. Both offer slight performance optimizations and allow Freya
/// to require additional dependencies.
